  abstract = {The advent of powerful neural classifiers has increased interest
              in problems that require both learning and reasoning. These
              problems are critical for understanding important properties of
              models, such as trustworthiness, generalization, interpretability,
              and compliance to safety and structural constraints. However,
              recent research observed that tasks requiring both learning and
              reasoning on background knowledge often suffer from reasoning
              shortcuts (RSs): predictors can solve the downstream reasoning task
              without associating the correct concepts to the high-dimensional
              data. To address this issue, we introduce rsbench, a comprehensive
              benchmark suite designed to systematically evaluate the impact of
              RSs on models by providing easy access to highly customizable tasks
              affected by RSs. Furthermore, rsbench implements common metrics for
              evaluating concept quality and introduces novel formal verification
              procedures for assessing the presence of RSs in learning tasks.
              Using rsbench, we highlight that obtaining high quality concepts in
              both purely neural and neuro-symbolic models is a far-from-solved
              problem. rsbench is available at: this https URL. },

              Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. Even though MMLU
              is widely adopted, our analysis demonstrates numerous ground truth
              errors that obscure the true capabilities of LLMs. For example, we
              find that 57% of the analysed questions in the Virology subset
              contain errors. To address this issue, we introduce a comprehensive
              framework for identifying dataset errors using a novel error
              taxonomy. Then, we create MMLU-Redux, which is a subset of 3,000
              manually re-annotated questions across 30 MMLU subjects. Using
              MMLU-Redux, we demonstrate significant discrepancies with the model
              performance metrics that were originally reported. Our results
              strongly advocate for revising MMLU's error-ridden questions to
              enhance its future utility and reliability as a benchmark.
              Therefore, we open up MMLU-Redux for additional annotation this

  abstract = {The field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy), which
              combines learning and reasoning, has recently experienced
              significant growth. There now are a wide variety of NeSy frameworks
              , each with its own specific language for expressing background
              knowledge and how to relate it to neural networks. This
              heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes
              comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a
              unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language
              for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of
              settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used
              in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a neuro-symbolic first-order
              syntax for which we provide example semantics including classical,
              fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. We believe ULLER is a first step
              towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving
              the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation
              across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.

  abstract = {Recent work has shown learning systems can use logical background
              knowledge to compensate for a lack of labeled training data. Many
              methods work by creating a loss function that encodes this
              knowledge. However, often the logic is discarded after training,
              even if it is still helpful at test time. Instead, we ensure neural
              network predictions satisfy the knowledge by refining the
              predictions with an extra computation step. We introduce
              differentiable refinement functions that find a corrected
              prediction close to the original prediction. We study how to
              effectively and efficiently compute these refinement functions.
              Using a new algorithm called iterative local refinement (ILR), we
              combine refinement functions to find refined predictions for
              logical formulas of any complexity. ILR finds refinements on
              complex SAT formulas in significantly fewer iterations and
              frequently finds solutions where gradient descent can not. Finally,
              ILR produces competitive results in the MNIST addition task.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

              reasoning. Recently introduced frameworks for Probabilistic
              Neurosymbolic Learning (PNL), such as DeepProbLog, perform
              exponential-time exact inference, limiting the scalability of PNL
              solutions. We introduce Approximate Neurosymbolic Inference
              (A-NeSI): a new framework for PNL that uses neural networks for
              scalable approximate inference. A-NeSI 1) performs approximate
              inference in polynomial time without changing the semantics of
              probabilistic logics; 2) is trained using data generated by the
              background knowledge; 3) can generate symbolic explanations of
              predictions; and 4) can guarantee the satisfaction of logical
              constraints at test time, which is vital in safety-critical
              applications. Our experiments show that A-NeSI is the first
              end-to-end method to solve three neurosymbolic tasks with
              exponential combinatorial scaling. Finally, our experiments show
              that A-NeSI achieves explainability and safety without a penalty in
              performance.},
