My dissertation 'Optimisation in Neurosymbolic Learning Systems' has **won the first [BNVKI Dissertation Award](https://ii.tudelft.nl/bnvki/bnvki-2025-phd-dissertation-award-results/)**! 
I received the award at [BNAIC/BENELEARN 2025](https://bnaic2025.unamur.be/programme.html), and was invited to give a plenary talk about my dissertation.
