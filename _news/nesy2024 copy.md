Our paper on [ULLER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00532), a general-purpose NeSy language, is accepted as a **spotlight oral** presentation at [NeSy 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2024/home?authuser=0). In addition, I'm presenting [my ICML paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08458) as a spotlight oral, and we are giving a tutorial on ULLER on Thursday the 12th of September.
