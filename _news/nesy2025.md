I was a **Program Chair** for the [NeSy 2025 conference](https://2025.nesyconf.org/) in Santa Cruz, USA from 8-10 September 2025. We had a great time, with 100+ attendees and great keynote speakers like Thomas Kipf and Guy Van den Broeck. I also presented our paper on [how the independence assumption relates to neurosymbolic reasoning shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357) as a **spotlight oral** and poster.
