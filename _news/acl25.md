Glad to share some papers I collaborated on with the Edinburgh NLP group. [MMLU-Redux](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04127) (**NAACL 2025**) fixes errors in the popular  MMLU dataset. [Mixtures of In-Context Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02830) (**ACL 2025**) uses mixtures of experts to improve in-context learning, and won an **SAC Highlight Award**. And we [explored learning Tool-Use with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05867) (**NAACL Findings 2025**).
