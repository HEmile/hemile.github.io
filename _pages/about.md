I am a postdoc in the [NLP group](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) and the [APRIL lab](https://april-tools.github.io/) at the University of Edinburgh under the [ELIAI program](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/eliai/about). I obtained a PhD with distinction (cum laude) in Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2024, where I am also a visiting researcher in the [Learning and Reasoning group](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/).

My research combines symbolic reasoning and machine learning, or “_Neurosymbolic Learning_”. It includes research into differentiable fuzzy logics and optimization with discrete latent variables. I developed the [Storchastic](https://github.com/HEmile/storchastic) PyTorch library, which implements many gradient estimation methods. I recently developed A-NeSI, a highly scalable Neurosymbolic method that uses neural networks for symbolic inference.

I’m also interested in Personal Knowledge Management and developed [Juggl](https://juggl.io/), a plugin for Obsidian.md that adds a customizable graph view. Other plugins include [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links).

I composed some music: [You can listen to some songs here](http://emilevankrieken.bandcamp.com/)!
