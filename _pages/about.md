<!-- **I am currently looking for academic opportunities in Machine Learning and AI.** -->


I am a postdoc in the [Learning and Reasoning group](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working jointly with [VISLab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/) at the University of Amsterdam. Before this position, I obtained a PhD with distinction (cum laude) in Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2024, and worked as a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh from 2023 to 2025. 

My research combines machine learning with background knowledge of various forms. 
I usually study methods in the field of “_neurosymbolic machine learning_”. 
My work focuses on the fundamental understanding of such combinations, including optimisation properties, characterisations of expressiveness, forms of background knowledge, and scalability. 
Currently, I am particularly interested in methods for neurosymbolic learning in generative AI models like LLMs and diffusion models, and in commonsense reasoning, particularly in visual domains. 
<!-- Another focus is the accessibility of Neurosymbolic Learning, to which end I lead the development of the [ULLER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00532) Python library -->

I also like personal knowledge management and developed [Juggl](https://juggl.io/), a plugin for Obsidian.md that adds a customizable graph view. Other plugins include [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links). I wrote an overview of my Obsidian workflow [here](https://www.emilevankrieken.com/blog/2025/academic-obsidian/). I also composed some music for Minecraft mods: [You can listen to some songs here](http://emilevankrieken.bandcamp.com/).
